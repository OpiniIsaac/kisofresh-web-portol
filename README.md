**Title:** KisoIndex: Empowering Farmers with Informed Pricing Decisions

**Description:**

KisoIndex is a web application designed to empower farmers with transparent and up-to-date information on agricultural product prices. This comprehensive index provides a central hub for farmers to access real-time or historical pricing data, helping them make informed decisions about their crops and maximize their profitability.

**Why?**

Farmers often face challenges in obtaining accurate and timely data on the prices of their products. Traditional methods involve contacting local buyers or relying on unreliable sources, leading to missed opportunities and potentially lower profit margins. KisoIndex aims to bridge this gap by providing a centralized platform with reliable price information, fostering greater transparency within the agricultural market.

**Quick Start:**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Use git to clone the KisoIndex repository from your preferred source (e.g., GitHub).
   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/your-username/kisoindex.git](https://github.com/OpiniIsaac/kisofresh-web-portol.git)
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run the command to install all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the Development Server:** Initiate the development server to launch the application locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will typically start the server on http://localhost:3000 by default.

**Usage:**

Once the development server is running, you can access KisoIndex in your web browser at the provided local URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000). The application's interface should guide farmers through features like:

* **Price Search:** Search for specific agricultural products by name or category to view current or historical price data.
* **Market Analysis:** Access insights and trends in agricultural product pricing to make informed decisions about planting, harvesting, and selling.
* **Subscription Service (Optional):** Consider implementing a subscription service (if not already included) where farmers can receive targeted price alerts and personalized market updates.
